# CSS - Cascading Style S-Expressions

Cascading Style S-Expressions allow you to write Cascading Style Sheets rules using S-expressions. For example,

```css
body {
    color: red;
}
```

becomes

```
(body color red)
```

This is a format for personal use, but of course, you can take a look if it interests you. I may or may not end up using this on my own [personal site](https://uncomputation.net).
